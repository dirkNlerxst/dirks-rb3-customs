# MOGG Replacements
These are audio replacements for songs that have issues, or could benefit from a new mix. For PS3 users, they're encrpyted so this is a drag/drop replacement within the appropriate folder. For 360 users, you will need to replace the mogg file in the CON file with Nautilus (formerly known as C3 Tools): https://bit.ly/nemoNAUTILUS

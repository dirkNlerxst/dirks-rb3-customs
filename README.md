# Dirk's RB3 Customs

# Audio Fixes
These are direct mogg replacements for songs that have issues, usually due to poor multitrack separation (these are encrypted by default for PS3 users). For PS3 users, this can be a drag/drop replacement within the appropriate folder. For 360 users, you will need to replace the mogg file in the CON file with Nautilus (formerly known as C3 Tools): https://bit.ly/nemoNAUTILUS
